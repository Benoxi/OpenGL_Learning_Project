# OpenGL_Learning_Project
Learning OpenGL with Visual Studio 2017 through the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEETnX-uPtBXT9T-hD0Bj31DSnwio-ywh

In the main project folder (the one containing the .sln file) I also have my packages folder, I couldn't upload the folder because of its size. So I am listing here what packages and versions I have within this project:

  - glm.0.9.9.300
  
  Also this OpenGL project was written for the 32-bit debugger (x86).
